# Dm-Tool
My project will be a dungeon master game tool meant for taking care of the important information like the player’s stats, locations, location descriptions, and to extent the game story.

At the minimum I want to be able to create a tool that will help me dm for my friends. I will be coding this in eclipse my native language. I think this would be possible if I make a detailed map with a 3d array and location descriptions which I think I’ll be able to accomplish with a program that reads descriptions from a file.

What I would like to end up with is a product that comes close to the quality of a dm program now. Of course I’d like to make it better than other dm programs but I think that there’s a lot of work ahead of me. Features I’d like to make are a in game detailed map with loot/map details/monsters the usual things you’d expect in game of dnd, I’d also like to keep track of the players stats like experience points, strength, intelligence, and so on, I would like to keep track of what they have equipped and what they have in there inventory.

Goal 1: Loading in character names and starting location.
Goal 2: Make a group class to make moving characters easier.
Goal 3: Keep track of and edit stats like con,int,etc.
Goal 4: Make a basic draft of a world map and enter it into the board array.
Goal 5: Make a enemy class that conatains stuff like level,stats,possible loot and exp drops.
Goal 6: Bug check and optimize all the above checkpoints and tie up all loose ends.
Goal 7: Create a item class that keeps track of damage,name,and type etc.
Goal 8: Create files to save the above information from the above classes.
